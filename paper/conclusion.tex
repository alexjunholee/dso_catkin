\section{Conclusion}

We have introduced a method to solve pose estimation problem by introducing continuous
trajectory fused with event camera, for robust convergence of slow and accurate depth sensors.
Our algorithm solves environment undersampling problem by robustly updating time-continuous
trajectory parameters to estimate poses between sparsely updated sensor measurements.
We also summarized results by showing robustness under lighting and motion variances on publicly
released dataset provided with calibration parameters and groundtruth. Our vision for visibility dataset
is the first public dataset to include three calibrated multi domain vision sensors, to provide
the standard to develop vision for visibility under real-world environments.
