Event cameras have arisen as an alternative solution to trajectory estimation problem
on real-world applications, by its consistent sensor measurement upon environmental variance.
In this paper, we present a method of estimating a continuous trajectory from event measurements
combined with a depth sensor. We combine sequential depth information with continuous
event stream to estimate a 6 DOF trajectory. From accurate depth measurements from the
infrared depth sensors or solid-state LiDARs, edge structures are extracted and fitted
into the events to estimate a polynomial spline trajectory. We show that to fully utilize
the benefits from continuous-time representation of events, camera localization should
be solved as a continuous trajectory estimation problem. We also release a public dataset
including dynamic lighting conditions and various motion
in indoor and outdoor, with ground-truth provided. The dataset can be downloaded from :
